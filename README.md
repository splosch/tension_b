# #tension_b || "Tension Bee"
Sketch of a super lightweight, easy assembly drone frame that is made sturdy by tension.

## Idea
Some flat & flexible bars e.g. Carbon Fiber or Glass Fiber flatbars are connected with simple / angled connectors in to a ring-shape. At least 2 but more edges can be used - in this demo 4 connectors form a ring-shape structure.

This structure can easily be assembled but will fall apart as well :)
If now tension is applied towards the center of the contraption e.g. with fishing-line or carbon rods.
The ring stabilizes and gets quite sturdy to bending from and towards the center.

Still flexing of corners is possible. By using an angled tensioning approach to each corner the contraption gets stury in all directions.

The Weak-Point here is the flexed flat-bar which if made out of Carbon-Fiber are actually pushing against the connectors - which will make them splinter if force is applied.
